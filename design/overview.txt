There are three languages that exist for the project:
	-	LES, the language which is the main goal
	-	PLES, a language for defining the reference implementation of LES
	-	ALES, a language for expressing the operational semantics of PLES

All languages that are a part of the project use a restricted subset of the syntax of LES.
